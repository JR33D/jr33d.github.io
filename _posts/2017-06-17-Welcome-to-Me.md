# Welcome to Me

I am not sure what I should expect from this, maybe I can finally get my thoughts together in one place. Maybe someone will see this and be inspired the do something amazing. I will apologize in advance as writing has never been a strong skill for me, so this may be painful to read at times. I promise to improve as we spend this time together to where ever this journey is going to take us. 

## Who am I
I am not sure there is a lot to me, although I know I have experienced a good bit for my age. I am into my career with a mere five years under my belt as a software engineer. I have a wonderful fiancee, a beautiful daughter, and a rowdy black lab. I cannot say my life has been difficult, but I have seen both sides; the silver spoon in mouth, and questioning if I will still have a roof over my head next month. When it is all said and done, I am still me and that's the best person I can be.
