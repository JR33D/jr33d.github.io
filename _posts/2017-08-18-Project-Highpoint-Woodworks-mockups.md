# Project: Highpoint Woodworks Part one - Mockups
A family member recently reached out to me about setting up their company with a website. In an effort to keep up with the latest technologies, I figured it would be a good idea to test my skills from simple idea to full production ready system. I've also decided to document my process and progress for the project. 

## The Reasoning
Highpoint Woodworks is the name of the company. Being a woodworking company they have a large variety of projects; trash cans, plant stands, bird houses, tables, cabinets, doors, staircases, pergolas, etc. I could go on and on. What would a woodworking company want with a website?

We do live in the golden age of technology and social media. It's a great way to reach an audience all over the world. Being able to reach people is easy. It’s the call to action and actually getting them to contact you and becoming potential clients that is the real turn around expectation for the website. To get people interested you have to show them something they like, Highpoint is already step up because they specialize in live-edge products for some of their smaller products. This keeps the character of the wood edge behind the bark, and makes it so every piece is as unique as the reclaimed tree it came from.

## The Requirements
As we just talked about there are a few items Highpoint is looking for once their website is up and running. 
 - They'd like customers to be able to contact them in some way.
 - We need to be able to show off their work so people can see if it’s their style or design.
 - Explaining about Highpoint's specialty and background.

Starting with just that list we have a few different pages of the website to start with; Gallery, Project, Contact, and About pages. None of these pages can really act as a landing page, a Home page can act as an anchor for the rest of the website.

## Mockup Overview
With those requirements and ideas I created the following five mockups using the web-app, <a href="https://moqups.com/">Moqups</a>, to create the various pages along with some interactions that I got approved by Highpoint. We'll dig into each page a little bit later.

      <img src="{{ "/media/Highpoint-Woodworks/mockups/Project-Page.jpg" | absolute_url }}" />
      <figcaption>Greater detail about each project.</figcaption>
   </figure>
</div>

## Home Page Mockup
<div class="large">
   ![]({{ "/media/Highpoint-Woodworks/mockups/Home-Page.jpg" | absolute_url }})
</div>

The home page is the main page for users to access content from. We have a static navigation and logo at the top for the company, along with an area to add an image of one of their projects on the right to balance out the logo on the left.

From there Highpoint request a Jumbo-Tron to be able to rotate and show some of their newest products. We don't want a log of information on the Home page, we want users to explorer the website and get more information from the other pages ultimately leading to them contact Highpoint as a client looking for something.

Along with the Jumbo-Tron, I figured three areas to cover items, like a featured project, customer reviews, and a schedule of art shows and displays where people might be able to see the work live and in person if they are in the area. In the footer area it'll be a static item like the header. Here will live links to all of the pages again, along with links to various social media accounts.

## About Page Mockup
<div class="large">
   ![]({{ "/media/Highpoint-Woodworks/mockups/About-Page.jpg" | absolute_url }})
</div>

The main content that we have for the About page is information about Highpoint, we want to highlight items like the fact that they use reclaimed wood from the North-East United States in all of their projects. This will also give us an area to talk about the owner and his experience as Cabinet Maker. I also wanted to add a few balance images here so that it isn't just a giant wall of text for the user to read. The target idea for the images are an action shot of the owner working on a project, as well as a professional headshot next to his brief biography.

## Contact Page Mockup
<div class="large">
   ![]({{ "/media/Highpoint-Woodworks/mockups/Contact-Page.jpg" | absolute_url }})
</div>

The contact page is one of the main reasons for having the website for Highpoint. They want potential clients to contact them about any and all project ideas. One side of this page is laid out in a form for users to fill out and submit, basic information like, name (First and Last), phone, email, and message. This should cover a good portion of any request that come in to allow them to be contacted back. On the other side will be some text or maybe another image, as a call to action for contacting Highpoint for their next project or gift needs.

## Gallery and Project Page Mockups
<div class="large">
   ![]({{ "/media/Highpoint-Woodworks/mockups/Gallery-Page.jpg" | absolute_url }})
</div>

The Gallery page is unique in this project as it doesn't contain a lot of text, mainly just names of the projects that can be selected to see more images, and details about it. Keeping with the balance of three columns from the Home page this page will be paginated, with 3 columns and two rows. This should allow the user to see almost all projects in a single page based on their screen size. After selecting a project from the Gallery the user is taken to the final page we have mocked up, the Project page.

<div class="large">
   ![]({{ "/media/Highpoint-Woodworks/mockups/Project-Page.jpg" | absolute_url }})
</div>

This page is very simple and modeled a bit after any e-commerce stores single product page. It will contain details about the project like wood type, size, and description. It can provide additional pictures that will replace the larger image on the page. I've thought about allowing customer endorsements for specific project/products or trying to relate projects to each other so people can see different types of work in the same category or area which would likely fill in the area under the large image and text.

## Steps moving forward

With the mockups done and approved, I'm on to the next step of choosing a technology stack and data structure that is mostly defined in the mockups already.
